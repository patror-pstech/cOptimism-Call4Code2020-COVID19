# cOptimism-Call4Code2020-COVID19
Challenge: This pandemic calls for Social Distancing/Quarantine, whether it is Self-imposed or imposed by the Governing bodies.  In such case, the main concern of common public is how to get essentials, like groceries, medicine, food, etc. Solution: Our solution bridges the business, customers, and delivery associates by capturing and sharing the info by different parties. Advantage: Different parties provide information, thus forming a Local News Pool. They provide their travel details (to stores or within and outside City, State, Country) along with other information like date and time, and infection status. This is stored and cascaded to other users in proximity of the infected and other possible people around them and generates a hot spot warning too. This can be integrated on Facebook Messenger/Slackbot, can send notifications via Whatsapp, SMS, Email, thus reducing the need for basic users to have an Android/iPhone/other advanced phones.

## Nice to Have:
